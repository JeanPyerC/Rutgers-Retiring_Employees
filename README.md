# Rutgers - Retiring Employees

## Overview of the analysis:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp:&nbsp Purpose of this project is to be able to read/understand SQL tables and to create your own database. Some companies will provide it's own custom report, however, it will be a great tool to have someone who can create reports that are needed for a specific task. In order to do this, you have to identify the different keys, the different tables, and being able to merge them. 

## Results:  
**1. The number of retiring employees by title.**  
 - By selecting certain columns from seperate tables, I was able to to create a new report with a better look of the table. By using the "INTO" clause, a new data table was created.

 - By using the "DISTINCT ON" statment, I was able to retrieve the first occurrence of the employee number for each set of rows defined by the "ON ()" clause. After that, I was able to use the "INTO" clause and create a new database.

## Summary:
**1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?**
 - Depending on the amount of work and upcoming projects, you will need fill in the role as soon as possible before you start feeling the impact.
 - I say start by promoting employees within the departments to fill in leaderships so they can direct the staff to urgent projects.

**2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**
 - About 1,940 employess who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
