# Rutgers - Retiring Employees

## Overview of the analysis:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp:&nbsp Purpose of this project is to be able to read/understand SQL tables and to create your own database. Some companies will provide it's own custom report, however, it will be a great tool to have someone who can create reports that are needed for a specific task. In order to do this, you have to identify the different keys, the different tables, and being able to merge them. 

## Results:  
 1. The number of retiring employees by title.  
 - By selecting certain columns from seperate tables, I was able to to create a new report with a better look of the table.
